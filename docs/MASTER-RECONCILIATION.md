# THE VIEWER — Master Reconciliation (all chats, all versions → one record)

**Compiled 2026-08-08, updated 2026-08-09.** This document exists because the project's own canonical docs had
drifted out of sync with each other across sessions. As of this update, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ITERATION-SNAPSHOTS.md`,
`HANDOFF-NOTE.md`, `PROJECT-SUMMARY.md`, and this file all agree on **v1.13.4**. This file is the reconciled,
single-source feature record, cross-checked against the actual files on disk (not just memory). It supplements —
does not replace — `CHANGELOG.md` (the full 217-entry per-change log) and `HANDOFF-NOTE.md` (the living session
hand-off). Treat all four as canonical going forward; keep them in sync.

**True current state: v1.13.4, shipped 2026-08-08.** Nothing has shipped between 2026-08-08 and today (2026-08-09)
— confirmed by CHANGELOG.md's newest entry. v1.13.4 was a full live-driving pass (every core feature exercised in
the actual running app) + a parallel static audit, together finding and fixing **36 real bugs** — see §6 for what
that closed out and §5 for the version-timeline entry. v1.13.3 (the point release just before it) was VERIFY.bat's
first-ever confirmed-green run on an actual host.

## 1 · Mission (unchanged since inception)

An **offline search engine with a dynamic GUI** over a library of military Technical Manuals — modeled on
EMS-NG / IADS / Adobe, "the best of all worlds" — for vehicle mechanics. Five founding goals, all shipped:

- **A. Find anything** in the TM/PDF corpus fast.
- **B. Many ways to search** — full-text, in-document Ctrl+F, offline Google-style predictive type-ahead.
- **C. Complete instructional rundowns** — disassembly/assembly, tools, torque, and clear differences between
  look-alike parts.
- **D. Richer-than-the-PDF graphics** — dynamic diagrams and 3-D, simple and advanced, for young mechanics and SMEs.
- **E. Effortless ingestion** of new files.

## 2 · System architecture (current shape, since the v0.96.0 "THE RESTRUCTURE")

- **Server:** `engine/viewer_app.py` — pure-stdlib `ThreadingHTTPServer`, `127.0.0.1:8765`, now a ~330-line thin
  shell. All domain logic lives in `engine/features/`: `registry` (declarative `{path:handler}` routes + central
  param validation), `routes` (every endpoint declared once), `corpus.py` (the one shared FTS retrieval layer,
  added v1.13.0), plus `search/parts/browse/procedures/render/ingest/sessions` feature modules.
- **UI:** plain HTML/JS in `engine/ui/`, no framework, ES5-safe for legacy hardware. Custom WebGL renderer
  (`gl3d.js`); shared widgets (`loupe.js`, `partview.js`, `cadview.js`, `schemflow.js`, `palette.js`, `scanner.js`,
  `readaloud.js`, `shared.js`).
- **Data:** corpus at `E:\ALL MILITARY TMS` — **read-only, never written** (R1/R6) — indexed into `index/viewer.db`
  (~3.65 GB+: documents, pages, OCR text layer, parts, ref_nsn/FLIS). Every feature adds its own **append-only
  sidecar** database under `index/` rather than touching the core schema outside migrations.
- **Tiers (RPS = Retroactive Post-Support):** `sysprobe.py` probes the host → modern / lite / legacy feature tiers,
  so the same codebase runs on an RTX-class Win11 box or a Win7/Vista shop-floor PC. **As of v1.13.2** the tier
  choice is a persisted Settings decision (Auto / Performance / Retroactive Post-Support), not just an env flag.
- **Two builds, one codebase** (`docs/FORKS.md`): the **Advanced/GPU production build** is the priority fork
  (RapidOCR on `onnxruntime-gpu`, 10–30× faster OCR) — `make_portable.bat` derives the **Lite/portable build**
  (finished index only, CPU-safe, one-click `SETUP.bat`/`START.bat`) for weaker machines. Same `viewer.db` schema
  either way; no divergent code.

## 3 · Standing rules governing every change (R1–R13, THE VIEWER-only)

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| R1 | Backwards-compatible + rollbackable; corpus read-only |
| R2 | Every addition ships with a data-flow diagram |
| R3 | Diagrams: professional dark theme + PDF |
| R4 | A `CHANGELOG.md` entry with every change |
| R5 | + a graphical changelog explanation (CHANGELOG-VISUAL) |
| R6 | Append-only data — add, never remove |
| R7 | Legacy builds get a dual-track changelog (`CHANGELOG-LEGACY.md`) with parity notes |
| R8 | Write a full HANDOFF note at session end / on request |
| R9 | Always use no-truncation discipline; verify completeness mechanically |
| R10 | Every iteration ships a **literal screenshot** of the running app (not a mock/diagram) — see §6, still owed |
| R11 | 100% info retrieval incl. dimensions → Wayback-routed external gap-fill → consolidated linkless Masterfile |
| R12 | Implement every method in `EXTRACTION-METHODS-CATALOG.md` until the app stands alone as a complete repository |
| R13 | **★ Above military grade** — built for eventual military use; accuracy sacred, extractive+cited, fail loud, verify like lives depend on it |

shared signal on pinouts (`harnesstrace.py`, `/api/harnesstrace`, 1.12.6).

### R13 trust, verification & safety layer
`validate.py` — quarantines garbled/impossible extracted values, red banner on `/part` (1.8.0) → **woven into**
`/measures` (per-row quality) and `conflicts.detect` (garble dropped pre-grouping so it can't fabricate a safety
conflict, 1.13.0) · `trust.py` canonical trust level + trust badges on measures/ask/conflicts/publogdiff (1.13.0) ·
`/verify` verification cockpit (last VERIFY result, module roster, DB integrity, 1.8.0; **had a 3-bug chain
meaning it found ZERO logs, ever, since the v0.96.0 restructure — wrong log filename, stale pass-regex, a
false-positive fail-trigger, plus a separate path-depth bug — all fixed 1.13.4, now correctly reads the real
current state**) · `signoff.py` — SME
approve/reject/override, append-only audit trail, `/review` (1.8.0) · `tmrev.py` — flags a superseded TM revision
(1.8.0) · `integrity.py` — SQLite corruption + SHA-256 tamper-evidence + online-safe backup (1.8.0) · `conflicts.py`

FSG/FSC group + NCB country (`nsndecode.py`, 1.12.3) · SMR (Source/Maintenance/Recoverability) code decoder
(`smrdecode.py`, 1.12.4) · CAGE/NCAGE validator (`cage.py`, 1.12.5) · all reachable via the **`/decode`** page +
palette command (added 1.12.9 after being found unreachable in audit).

### Fleet readiness & training
Per-system fluids/capacities (`fluidsmatrix.py`) + service intervals (`intervals.py`) + `/readiness` page (1.11.0)
· bulk folder ingestion (`ingestpipe.py` + `BULK-INGEST.bat`, 1.11.3) · cited multiple-choice **learn mode**
(`training.py`, `/learn`, `/api/quiz`, 1.9.0) · append-only **field notes** w/ SME endorsement (`fieldnotes.py`,
`/api/notes`, 1.9.0) · interactive demo/tour doubling as onboarding → hands off to the side chooser (0.83.x).

temp/flow/speed/rotation/angle), live `/measures` (1.1.0) · **`tables.py`** — PyMuPDF spec/dimension table detection
(1.1.1) · **`enrich.py`** — external gap-fill ONLY where the corpus is silent, every link routed through the
Wayback Machine, badged `external-unconfirmed` w/ full provenance, opt-in crawler only (`ENRICH.bat`) — app stays
100% offline (1.1.2, hardened to "Wayback-everything" at 1.1.3) · **`masterfile.py`** — consolidates
corpus+external into one congruent `index/masterfile.db`, RAW+FILTERED layers, no external links surfaced,
`/master` (1.1.4) · **`macchart.py`** MAC parser (1.12.8, see workflow section) · `docs/EXTRACTION-COVERAGE.md` /
`docs/EXTRACTION-METHODS-CATALOG.md` track R12's march toward every method in the catalog being implemented.

(0.63) · custom mutation-testing harness (0.72.3) · **`corpus.py`** unified FTS retrieval used by every consumer,
pooled `doc_path()`, startup auto-optimizer (WAL + bg indexes), bounded worker pool, `safeguard.atomic_write`
everywhere (1.13.0 groundwork) · **persisted RPS run-mode** — Auto/Performance/Retroactive-Post-Support saved to
Settings, `/api/rps_mode` (1.13.2, the current latest).

### Dev / verify / ops tooling
Route smoke tests, static audits, end-to-end demo/test suite, the VERIFY-*.bat family · root **`VERIFY.bat`** —
the single authoritative gate: exit-code truth, `run_timeout.py` wall-clock guards (no step can hang for
hours), unions audit + GET/POST route sweeps (**281 routes green**) + all regression suites + `rps_lint` +
`verify_ui` + `check_crlf` + module self-tests + no-truncation completeness (1.13.0, hang-proofed 1.12.7) —
**confirmed GREEN on an actual host for the first time in 1.13.3**, and again after the larger 1.13.4 hardening
pass (563 PASS / 0 FAIL, 658/658 files intact both times) · `engine/tools/check_crlf.py` — repo-wide CRLF gate
for `.bat` files (83 verified, 1.13.0) · `safeguard.py backupdb` — VACUUM INTO + disk guard + keep-2, manual
(1.13.0; still never actually run — see §6) · **resource-leak hardening** (1.13.3/1.13.4) — 13 sites across 11
modules where a query throwing after a lazy-validated `sqlite3.connect()` skipped `close()`, leaking a Windows
file handle; all now `con=None` + `finally` · **two uncached multi-second aggregate endpoints** TTL-cached
(`/command`, `/coverage` share one cache; `/verify`'s integrity check separately, 300s + `?force=1`) (1.13.4).

## 5 · Version timeline — the major cuts

| Milestone | What changed |
|---|---|
| pre-0.4x | Foundational monolith build: server, corpus indexing, base FTS search (earliest detail not preserved in current docs — superseded by the restructure below) |
| **v0.96.0 "THE RESTRUCTURE"** | Monolith `viewer_app.py` → thin shell + `engine/features/` package; rollback in `backups/pre-v0.96-restructure/` |
| 0.97 / 0.98 | Search-quality (NEAR/phrase, did-you-mean) + UI dedup; nav consolidation (Collections/Tools menus) |
| 0.99.x | Pre-1.0 polish wave: Work Order builder, `/locate`, `/coverage`, deep-zoom callouts, semantic+visual search, ingest drag-drop, palette Recent+tags |
| **v1.0.0** | First cut — all five founding pillars live; two-tier build (GPU/production + RPS legacy); quality bar = fuzz+mutation+no-truncation gates unioned in `RUN-ALL-VERIFY.bat` |
| v1.1.0 → 1.1.4 | Extraction + enrichment + Masterfile wave (measures/tables/enrich/masterfile) |
| v1.4.0 → 1.6.0 | Bay-floor batch (QR/kiosk/spec-sheet) → PUBLOG/FLIS catalog + scanner + hybrid search → look-alike intelligence + approximate 3-D |
| v1.7.0 → 1.9.0 | Unified `/part` + job PDF + troubleshooting + conflicts + offline Q&A → **R13 trust layer** (validate/verify/signoff/integrity/tmrev) → serviceability/kit/pinouts/training/field-notes |
| v1.10.0 → 1.12.9 | RPSTL + cross-method scoring + 200-idea roadmap → fleet readiness (readiness/handover/PMCS/bulk-ingest) → decoder + safety batch (air-gap/standards/2407/NSN/SMR/CAGE/harness-trace/MAC) → deep audit closing route-coverage gaps |
| **v1.13.0** | HOLISTIC HARDENING — four-lane dev-team review: search operators, one-time-use flags, gap log, precomputed conflicts; `corpus.py` unification; trust badges everywhere; `VERIFY.bat` as the one gate; UI coherence pass; independent audit + adversarial hardening (63 hostile cases, 0 fixes needed) |
| v1.13.1 | AI-generated 3-D illustrative tier (Meshy import lane) |
| v1.13.2 | RPS run-mode becomes a persisted Settings choice |
| v1.13.3 | `VERIFY.bat` confirmed GREEN on an actual host for the first time — 2 real bugs found doing it (a resource leak, a duplicate-append bug) |
| **v1.13.4 (current)** | Full live-driving pass (every core feature exercised live, not just automated suites) + a parallel static audit → **36 real bugs found and fixed**: 12 resource leaks (13 combined with v1.13.3's), 3 dedup/caching issues, 10 regex/classification bugs (incl. two that violated the app's own "never fabricate" R13 discipline), 2 misc, plus the `verifystate.py`/`/verify` chain that had silently found nothing since the v0.96.0 restructure |

## 6 · Known outstanding items (host-side, still owed as of today)

**Resolved since the last update** (kept here, struck through in spirit, for continuity — see §5 for detail):
`VERIFY.bat` confirmed GREEN on host (v1.13.3, reconfirmed v1.13.4) · the pre-OCR `safeguard.py` snapshot
re-baselined repeatedly through v1.13.4 (current: `SNAP_20260808_184421_v1.13.4-changelog`) ·
`docs/PROJECT-SUMMARY.md` fully rewritten (2026-08-08) and kept in sync through v1.13.4 · the resource-leak /
uncached-endpoint / regex-fabrication classes of bug that a full audit specifically went looking for are now
fixed (36 of them, v1.13.4) — though see item 3 below for the one deliberately-deferred piece of that same class.

**Still open:**
1. **R10 literal screenshots have never actually been saved as artifacts.** `docs/screenshots/` still holds only
   a README of intended routes. The v1.13.4 session DID live-drive the real app with real screenshots (3D
   library + interactive CAD viewer, schematics + Living Schematic flow, Circuit Lab running a simulation, kiosk
   mode) and visually confirmed every core page renders correctly — but none were saved to `docs/screenshots/`,
   only viewed inline during the session. This remains the single most consistently-deferred action across every
   session. Needs a screenshot captured and saved per major page using the `<version>-<page>.png` convention.
2. **`BUILD-CONFLICTS.bat`** — first precomputed conflict-sweep run, still never run; `index/conflicts.db`
   doesn't exist yet. Optional while OCR is paused.
3. **`measures.py`'s bare-number-fused-to-single-letter-unit ambiguity** (e.g. an RPSTL item number "489A"
   reading as "489 Amps") — the same bug class the v1.13.4 audit fixed several instances of elsewhere
   (`fluidsmatrix.py`'s "12L", `measures.py`'s own oil-grade/newline cases), but this specific one is broader
   and needs corpus-wide regression testing before a safe fix. Documented in `CHANGELOG.md` `[1.13.4]`, not yet
   patched.
4. **`safeguard.py backupdb`** (the full off-index DB backup + rotation, distinct from the snapshot vault above)
   — documented, manual, still never actually run.
5. **OCR completion** — was ~43.8% at the v1.0.0 cut; **confirmed 94.4% as of the v1.13.4 session** (live
   `/status` check, 2026-08-08: 1,745,197 of 1,848,465 pages searchable). Check current % via `/command` or
   `/status` before assuming it's fully finished.
6. **A live analytics record still carries an old bad NSN** (dated 2026-06-01, traced during v1.13.4's
   live-driving pass to a since-fixed bad example-data bug) — real historical data, R6 append-only, left for the
   user to decide whether to touch.

## 7 · Downloadable artifacts produced across the project's life

- **`docs/diagrams/`** — 185 dark-theme diagram PDFs (+ matching SVGs, several with PNG previews and `.mmd`
  sources), one pair per addition per R2/R3, numbered roughly 00→113+ plus named ones (`CHANGELOG-VISUAL.pdf`,
  `CHANGELOG-DUALTRACK.pdf`).
- **`docs/CHANGELOG.md`** (217 entries) / **`docs/CHANGELOG-LEGACY.md`** (141 entries, dual-track parity per R7).
- **`docs/ITERATION-SNAPSHOTS.md`** + **`docs/ITERATION-DASHBOARD.html`** — the tagged FEATURE/UPGRADE/POLISH/FIX
  index (217 iterations, 139 legacy-tracked), regenerable via `engine/build_iteration_snapshot.py`.
- **`docs/HANDOFF-NOTE.md`** — the living session hand-off (reconciled to v1.13.4).
- **`docs/ocr_example_before_after.pdf`** — OCR quality proof.
- **`docs/RELEASE-NOTES-1.0.md`** — the v1.0.0 release notes.
- This file, **`docs/MASTER-RECONCILIATION.md`**.
- Data deliverables (not "downloads" in the document sense, but produced artifacts): `index/viewer.db`,
  `index/publog.db`, `index/masterfile.db`, `index/cadcache/` (~32,622-part CAD render cache), `index/conflicts.db`.
